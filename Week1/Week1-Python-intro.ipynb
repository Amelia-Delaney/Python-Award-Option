    "### Week 1: Introduction to Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand Python syntax, variables, and basic data types.\n",
    "- Write simple scripts using input/output with basic calculations.\n",
    "- Learn to define and use simple functions (subroutines)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Variable Assignment and Data Types**:\n",
    "   - Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a program.\n",
    "   - Common data types include:\n",
    "     - `int` (integer): Whole numbers, e.g., `5`, `-3`\n",
    "     - `float` (floating-point): Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`\n",
    "     - `str` (string): Sequence of characters, e.g., `\"hello\"`, `\"123\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input and Output**:\n",
    "   - `input()`: Function to take user input.\n",
    "   - `print()`: Function to display output to the console.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "     print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simple Mathematical Operations**:\n",
    "   - Basic arithmetic operations: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division).\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     a = 10\n",
    "     b = 5\n",
    "     sum = a + b\n",
    "     print(f\"The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **String Concatenation using f-strings**:\n",
    "   - f-strings provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     age = 20\n",
    "     print(f\"I am {age} years old\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "5. **Functions (Subroutines)**:\n",
    "   - Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be reused.\n",
    "   - Defined using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def greet(name):\n",
    "         print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "     \n",
    "     greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Functions with Return Values**:\n",
    "   - Functions can return a value using the `return` keyword.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def add(a, b):\n",
    "         return a + b\n",
    "     \n",
    "     result = add(3, 4)\n",
    "     print(f\"The sum is {result}\")\n",
    "     ```"

    "    to Celcius using functions\n",
    "   - all variable names are meaningful\n",
    "   - Formula: `F = C * 9/5 + 32`, `C = (F-32) * 5/9`\n",
