    "## **Notes on Inheritance**\n",
    "Inheritance is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class). This helps in **code reuse** and makes the program more organised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points:**\n",
    "1. **Creating a Child Class**  \n",
    "   - A child class inherits from a parent class by specifying it in parentheses:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent:\n",
    "       def parent_method(self):\n",
    "           print(\"This is a method in the parent class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent):  # Inheriting from Parent\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   obj = Child()\n",
    "   obj.parent_method()  # Output: This is a method in the parent class.\n",
    "The `Child` class now has access to `parent_method()` without redefining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overriding Parent Methods\n",
    "If the child class needs a different implementation of a method, it can override the method from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show_message(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Message from Parent\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def show_message(self):  # Overriding the method\n",
    "        print(\"Message from Child\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Child()\n",
    "obj.show_message()  # Output: Message from Child\n"
